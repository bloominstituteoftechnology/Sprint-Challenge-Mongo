  "description": "* The purpose of this exercise is to get you used to being quizzed on _Interview   Questions_ commonly asked about Mongo. * Answers to your written questions will be recorded in _Answers.md_ * This is to be worked on alone but you can use outside resources. You can   _reference_ any old code you may have, and the React Documentation, however,   please refrain from copying and pasting any of your answers. Try and   understand the question and put your responses in your own words. Be as   thorough as possible when explaining something. * **Just a friendly Reminder** Don't fret or get anxious about this, this is a   no-pressure assessment that is only going to help guide you here in the near   future. This is NOT a pass/fail situation.   ## Start by forking and cloning this repository.   ## Questions - Self Study - You can exercise your Google-Fu for this and any other _Sprint Challenge_ in the future.",
